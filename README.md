# color_code
A quick syntax file for taking color coded notes in sublime text, compatible with all your favorite color schemes out of the box.

For my personal use, mostly.

Written with Sublime Text Build 4121.

# Current highlights:

`" ... "` in-line double quotes,

`"* ... 
... *"` block double quotes,

`// ...` c style end-of-line comments,

`/* ...
... */` c style block comments,

`#` python style end-of-line comments,

`#* ...
... *#` this weird style of block comments that I *really* wish python had,

`!! ...` end-of-line emergencies,

`!* ...
... *!` block emergencies,

ALL CAPS (including numbers and underscores),

Proper Nouns (including numbers and underscores),

digits outside of caps and nouns,

math symbols and punctuation,

a basic version of url links,

and a few other random small things that I forgot!
