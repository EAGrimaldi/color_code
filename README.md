# color_code
A quick syntax file for taking color coded notes in sublime text, compatible with your favorite sublime text color scheme.

For my personal use.

# Current highlights:

`" ... "` in-line double quotes,

`"* ... 
... *"` block double quotes,

`// ...` c style end-of-line comments,

`/* ...
... */` c style block comments,

`#` python style end-of-line comments,

`#* ...
... *#` this weird style of block comments that I *really* wish python had,

`!! ...` end-of-line emergencies,

`!* ...
... *!` block emergencies,

ALL CAPS (including numbers and underscores),

Proper Nouns (including numbers and underscores),

digits outside of caps and nouns,

math symbols and punctuation,

a basic version of url links,

and a few other random small things that I forgot!
